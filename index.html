        <h1>First off, how did I get here?</h1>
        <h3>*Hint....barely!</h3>
        <p>I herold from the land of pumpkins, Calabasas, California. Skip a couple of dog years and I made my way to Colorado in search of something new, exciting, and challenging.
            Success! Received a Bachelors in History and regretted it ever since! I often think back on what I should of majored in. Something I can see myself doing for many, many years.
             There was a longing inside me to go into a line of work that involved using my hands and can use my creativity to create wild and weird things for fun. Enter Hospitality.
            <br>
            <br>
           There was once a time I really enjoyed people. Hospitality allowed me to use my creativity to create unique guest experience and get down and dirty with tons of housekeeping projects. 
            When I graduated I thought that is the field I wanted to go into and that I would be happy forever. I'm still in hospitality. Been through many different roles from front desk, housekeeping 
             manager, and to my now current role of sales manager in downtown Denver. It is not a bad gig really. Monday - Friday and really anyone can do it so it was easy as s%^*!. So why don't I like people like I used to? Too long of a story but if you work in the service industry for a couple
              months then you will understand. I still wasn't happy. So I started the age long question within my soul...you need a change that will fulfill you for the rest of your and don't f it up. 
              Then, Brian descended and pointed toward my general life direction and said, "Want to make Hangman?".
            <br>
            <br>
           My email notified me that there is a meetup that I may be interested in. Once I looked at what it was I immediately said to myself, "OMG, this sounds dope!". The meetup was Learning to Code at the Denver Public Library. 
           The day came and I was so excited. At work I couldn't concentrate. There were meetings, I didn't pay attention. 5pm came, so did the nerves. Will this be the one? No time to think to hardly because I had to book it to the 
           library because my car was out of commission. Walking there I realized I had forgotten my laptop, rookie league. I borrowed a 1998 Dell Xp something from the library stash and walked in the classroom. Little did I know
           that this would lead to today. I struggled through the exercise, from what seemed easy for most people in the room. Boy was this exciting! Brian was the one leading the class and before the end, he plugged his a most glorious 
           plug. He mentioned a class he had put together for beginners to learn how to code....and it was for free! The thought of becoming a programmer I still remember this feeling and hope to never forget it. To Brian it was just a sentence, but to me it was salvation. 

           Here we are now. Got through Learning to code 101 and now attacking 102. At no time in my life has anyone EVER considered me smart, so when I tell them I am in a programming class I get "the look". The instant judgement.
           The realization of changing careers is still a pipe dream that I don't bank on (nor does anyone I know) because I am just having fun and I hope that translates. I can always study more, hangout with friends less, and go to more meetups involving programming.
           I'm still figuring it out. I never want to feel like I have a grasp on programming. Good thing I have history.

        <h1>That trip I mentioned</h1>
        <h3>Do you even study abroad bro?</h3>
        <p>The year was 2011, a year before the supposed end of the world and my final year at the University of Colorado at Boulder. 
            The end of the world didn't end up happening, but I still saw the end of my college career and I wasn't satisfied. Sometimes
            there are things in my life that I see or hear about and hone in on it hard. This was one of those times. I semi-pride myself on 
            doing things a little different in both action and thought. So when I came up with the idea to go abroad my second to last semester
            I wanted to go somewhere I have never heard of, I didn't know the language of, and most importantly a place people don't usually go
            for study abroad. 
        </p>
        <p>Walking into the study abroad office was both exciting and very scary. A new adventure awaited me, but the realization of it happening
            was still far away in both mind and body. Browsing the many catalogs of foreign lands, I landed on one that had noticeably less brouchurs. The architecture, culture, location, 
            and mystery intrigued me. I opened it up and I immediately decided this was the place, Prague, Czech Republic. I left with brochure in hand and dreams of 
            not understanding the locals. And then I had another idea.

            If you are going to Europe with no guarantee of goin gback any time soon, then make it longer. I decided to backpack a month before my 
            start date with my girlfriend at the time and her best friend and we each got to decided on a country to visit. Those ended up being Greece, Italy, and Croatia (my pick).
