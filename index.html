            <h2>The Rabbit Hole</h2>
            <p>
                I never knew keyboards existed like this before. They come in all sorts of sizes such as full-size, 75%, 65%, 60%, 50%, 40%, and even 27%. Keycaps come in different
                profiles such as SA, GMK, XDA, DSA. Keyboards with different layouts where CapsLock was removed and replaced with Control, and the Windows keys 
                were removed for another more useful key or just removed all together. All sorts of keycap colorways with different themes that just drew me in. 
                My goal is just to bring some knowledge on the hobby.

            <h2>Sizes</h2>

            <h3>Full Size</h3>

                You know these. They look like every other keyboard you are used to seeing. But what if you don't need all those keys or need to save precious space on your desk?

            <h3>TKL</h3>

            <p>
                Also known as Ten Keyless. These are for those who don't find themselves reaching for the ten number keys and are perfectly fine with reaching the ones just above their fingertips.

            <h3>65%</h3>
            <!-- ADD IMAGE HERE-->
            <p>
                Now we are getting closer to what your laptop might look like. You are left with the Alphas, the Modifiers (Shift, Enter, Control, etc..), and your arrow keys. Not bad. Small and pretty efficient. 
                But, what if you don't like reaching for your arrow keys when you need them or just don't used them that much because you are comfortable navigating otherwise?

            <h3>60%</h3>
            <!-- ADD IMAGE HERE-->
            <p>Well then this is the board for you! I personally like this layout the most. It is everything the 65% is but minus the arrow keys. How often do you use those anyway. Another bonus to this layout
                is that it is arguably the most asthetically pleasing.
